# drop-n-share
:heart::heart::heart::heart:

File sharing web app built with webrtc. The webrtc creates a p2p :couple: environment to share the file without involving the server in between. The initial signaling/handshaking is done via node server.

## usage 
```bash
npm install && node app
```

## how it works ?
- drop a file
- copy the link and give it to receiver

## todos

Its just basic and works well only for small files. Many things remainig to do.
